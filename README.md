# 💡 Challenges Faced

During development several challenges were encountered:

- Configuring Firebase Authentication
- Implementing Protected Routes
- Managing React State efficiently
- Performing Firestore CRUD operations
- Restricting users to view only their own tasks
- Handling asynchronous Firebase operations
- Maintaining responsive layouts across devices
- Debugging routing and JSX syntax errors

These challenges were resolved through component restructuring and proper Firebase integration.

---

# 📌 Assumptions Made

The application assumes that:

- Every user has a valid email address.
- Users authenticate using Email and Password.
- Every task belongs to exactly one authenticated user.
- Firestore security rules restrict unauthorized access.
- Internet connectivity is available while using the application.

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:

- Task Categories
- Drag and Drop Task Management
- Dark Mode
- Due Date Notifications
- Email Reminders
- Task Attachments
- Task Priority Colors
- Real-time Firestore Updates
- User Profile Management
- Team Collaboration
- Activity History
- Calendar View
- Export Tasks to PDF/Excel
- Unit Testing
- Offline Support
